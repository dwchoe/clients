    <p>
    I started my career in the hair industry in 1993.  I walked into the Aveda Institute and knew that this was my calling.  I went back to my corporate job and gave my notice.  Thirty days later, I started my new journey and have never looked back.
     I love meeting new clients and creating a new look for them. Styles that I create can start from simply adding bangs to more complex styles such as adding color with foils.  My favorite styles are when a client wants a new cut and color.  I'm all about creating the entire image!
     My work experience is not limited. I work with people who are on chemotherapy and need to have their hair clippered or cut into a shorter length.  This is a hard transition and decision for clients and I am honored that my clients ask me to be apart of their journey.
     These past 18 years have been wonderful; I look foreward to continuing my journey at SEOUL SALON.</p>

    <p>
    I'm a St. Paul native that has been doing hair since 1994. Giving easy to style haircuts is something 
    I excel at. Adding natural looking color or foils to complement your cut is also a strength. I love 
    going to work knowing that every day is different and that I get to spend my work days with my awesome client friends!
