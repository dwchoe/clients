      “I have always been very pleased with the  Nicole's work and I am so happy she has opened Seoul Salon. I would definitely  recommend this salon to anyone. Nicole is incredibly talented and  knowledgeable. The salon is funky and fun too.”</p>

    <p class="style1">“I absolutely love Nik's cuts! It's  very difficult to find a hair stylist who can handle Asian hair. She's the only  person I would trust my hair with, and I've never been disappointed. I always  recommend her to friends and family for colors, cuts, and styles. Her salon is  hip and modern just like her cuts!&quot;</p>

    Rachel is a wonderful hair stylist. I have very fine, thinning hair so when it is not cut right it is hard for me to hide it or work with it. 
    She gives such precision hair cuts that continue to be workable the entire life of the cut. This precision is consistent from cut to cut. 
    She also does my two teenage daughter's hair. She does such a good job making the style and color work for both the child and the parent of 
    the child. I feel very honored to be a client of her's.

      <p class="style1">"Jeannie has styled my hair for 2 years.  Our “color adventures” have always been great fun.  She is a master at knowing which combinations would turn out looking great.  I like to have fun with my hair, but need to keep it age and work appropriate.  She makes sure I walk out looking exciting and fresh.  I think we use the word “stunning”!  I always get lots of compliments from friends and co-workers, and my son, the harshest critic says, “it looks good.”

      <p class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="style1"> "Jeanie is such a gifted artist. I have found her to be incredibly intuitive and thoughtful in her approach to her work.  In the many years I have been her client, she has nurtured my seriously damaged platinum hair into colors that are actually found in nature, restoring depth and richness and sheen.  She has managed my hair through super short and waist-length cuts and everything in between.  She is content with my every mood. I have followed her to four locations. Work with her once, and you will understand why."  </p>
      <p class="style1">-<strong><em>-Buffy Sedlechek</em></strong></p>
      <p class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="style1">"Jeanie has been cutting my hair for over ten years, and I cannot imagine going to anyone else.  She has a wonderful personality and I always feel better after a visit to see her, plus, I receive many compliments on my hair. In addition to her cutting and coloring skills, she provides great customer service."</p>
